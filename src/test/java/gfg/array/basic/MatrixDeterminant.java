/**
 * The determinant of a matrix is a special number you can find for square matrices
 * (where the number of rows equals the number of columns). It helps in solving linear
 * equations and finding the matrix's inverse.
 * <p>
 * Hereâ€™s how to calculate it:
 * <p>
 * Find the cofactor: For each element in the first row or column, calculate its cofactor.
 * Multiply: Multiply each element by its cofactor.
 * Add with alternating signs: Add all these products together, making sure to alternate
 * the signs.
 * <p>
 * Let's say we have a 2x2 matrix:
 * <p>
 * | 1 2 |
 * | 3 4 |
 * To find the determinant, we calculate the cofactors for each element:
 * <p>
 * C11 = 4
 * C12 = -3
 * C21 = -2
 * C22 = 1
 * Then we multiply each element by its cofactor and add them together, alternating the signs:
 * <p>
 * Determinant = (1 * 4) - (2 * -3) + (3 * -2) - (4 * 1)
 * = 4 + 6 - 6 - 4
 * = 0
 * Note:
 * The determinant of 1*1 matrix is the element itself.
 * The Cofactor of any element of the stated matrix can be calculated by eliminating the row
 * and the column of that element from the matrix stated.
